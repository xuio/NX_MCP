# Real NX validation gate

## Historical upstream batch run

- Date: 2026-08-21
- NX: v2506 (`ugraf.exe` 2506.4021; `run_journal.exe` 2506.4000)
- NX embedded Python: 3.12.9
- Sidecar: Python 3.12.7 with `mcp` 1.27.0
- Host: Windows 11 build 26200
- Mode: `run_journal.exe` batch journal with main-thread request pumping
- Result: one acceptance run and 20 consecutive runs passed.

This validates the Python bridge for the recorded batch environment. It does
not validate non-blocking interactive NX GUI responsiveness.

## Record before testing

- Exact NX release/build and installed maintenance pack
- NX Python version and architecture
- Sidecar Python and `mcp` versions
- Whether NX is native or Teamcenter-managed mode
- Test machine identifier and Windows version

The upstream baseline was scoped to that build. The fork adds separately recorded NX 2606 graphical fixtures.

## Preconditions

- Use a disposable `NX_MCP_WORKSPACE`; do not copy production parts into it.
- Install this package in the sidecar interpreter. The supplied NX journal
  examples load the checkout's `src` directory and require only NX's standard
  Python library, not `mcp` or `pydantic`.
- Before starting the bridge, set `NX_MCP_PROBE_OUTPUT` to a JSON file inside
  the disposable workspace and run `examples/nx_runtime_probe.py` as an NX
  journal. It must report `"bridge_import_error": null`.
- Enable `NX_MCP_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_PYTHON_BRIDGE=1` only during feasibility.

Set `NX_MCP_BRIDGE_STOP_FILE` to a new path inside the disposable workspace
before running `start_nx_bridge.py` with `run_journal.exe`. The journal pumps
each bridge request on NX's main thread, keeps NX alive until that file is
created, then stops the bridge cleanly. The supplied Python runner requires
this batch mode.

## Acceptance command

```powershell
python -m nx_mcp.real_smoke --workspace D:\NX_MCP_WORKSPACE --iterations 20 --run-prefix acceptance
```

Every iteration must connect, create a metric part, create and finish an XY
rectangle sketch, extrude a new body, query the result, fit the view, export
STEP, undo the extrude, verify the original body count, save, and close. A
prefix must be unique for each rerun because NX will not overwrite a part.

## Pass criteria

- All 20 iterations pass without retry.
- The batch journal does not crash or hang.
- Every STEP and part file stays within the workspace.
- No partial geometry remains after a failed command or undo.
- Bridge stop/start and NX restart are followed by successful reconnection.
- Invalid token, path traversal, no work part, wrong-kind ID, and stale ID fail
  with their documented error codes.

If clean unload or GUI responsiveness fails, do not remove the feasibility
gate. Implement the minimal C# NX-side bridge or a non-blocking UI scheduler
and rerun this entire matrix before changing the package version from
`0.2.0.dev0` to `0.2.0`.

## GitHub Actions self-hosted gate

The repository provides `.github/workflows/real-nx.yml` for this acceptance
gate. It is intentionally manual so ordinary pull requests are not blocked
until a dedicated NX runner exists. The runner must have the labels
`self-hosted`, `windows`, and `nx`, plus a runner-level `NX_RUN_JOURNAL`
environment variable containing the absolute path to `run_journal.exe`.

The workflow creates a disposable workspace, runs the embedded-runtime probe,
starts the Python bridge, then runs `pytest -m real_nx`. It requests the bridge
to stop even when acceptance fails. Once the runner is reliable, make this
workflow a required release/branch gate in the repository settings; the normal
hosted CI deliberately excludes `real_nx` because it cannot provide Siemens NX.

## NX 2606 integration evidence

Dev18 runtime `9254c028eac8ffdfeed54201377ba62a052b0a1c` passed 868 ordinary tests
at 79.08% branch coverage, sidecar type checks and hosted CI. One dedicated NX
runner test was skipped in that suite. Separate graphical checks verified UI-thread
dispatch, stdio/HTTP, installed-source identity and native PNG delivery. Session
preservation checked 38 saved original parts and 116 occurrence paths, poses,
suppression states and reference sets.

Two fresh agents completed analytic plate, three-instance assembly and STEP
round-trip fixtures. The comparison used dev17 full versus initial dev18 agent;
final pagination/discovery fixes received a separate follow-up. Provider usage
was unavailable; response tokenizer counts are not total model costs.

Historical release receipts are retained in git history and local evidence, rather
than one documentation file per deployment. The [capability matrix](capability-matrix.md)
is generated from the runtime manifest. Do not promote a label based on builder
presence, a mock test or an unrelated native fixture.

## Running integration suites

Use isolated fixtures and a configured public MCP endpoint. Native scripts live
under `examples/validate_*.py`; each documents its endpoint/output variables.
`scripts/validate_native_release.py` coordinates the release suites. Run mutations
serially and preserve the original loaded parts, modified flags and work/display
selection. After failures, record outcomes and restore the session before retrying.

`scripts/build_release.py --output <directory>` packages a clean committed checkout
with locked Windows dependencies. Installation/rollback scripts preserve backups;
verify archive and installed-source hashes. Record exact runtime commit, NX build,
fixture checks and artifact hashes with each native run. Re-run changed behavior
on the release candidate instead of relabeling earlier evidence.

## Remaining legacy entry points

The dev19 closeout reproduced three failures in dev18: typed-reference angle
lookup, the missing sketch constraint enum, and feature deletion through
`FeatureCollection.ToArray`. The replacement handlers use live references and
supported native editing/update paths. `examples/validate_remaining_tools.py`
checks perpendicular-line angles, horizontal constraints, inventories, rename,
nested Save As, extrusion deletion, view selection, relative-placement replay,
explosion deletion and downloaded assembly ZIP contents. Save As references are
reacquired before subsequent edits. Non-running cancellation is an expected error;
cooperative cancellation is classified from sidecar/batch-boundary tests, not
from an unperformed mid-builder interruption test.

The initial isolated run exposed the stale-reference assumption in the test;
it restored the original session and was retained as a failed attempt. The
corrected run passed on candidate `b2584eeef629791b04cf6ad68fe40a428bfe5aec`.
Per-option limits remain in the capability matrix even when the overall entry
point is marked tested. This does not make every exposed variant native-tested.
