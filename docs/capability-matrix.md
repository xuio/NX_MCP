# Capability evidence matrix

Generated from `src/nx_mcp/capability_manifest.json`; do not edit this table by hand.
Run `python scripts/generate_capability_matrix.py` to regenerate, or add `--check` to detect drift.

Manifest revision: **2606-manufacturing-r1**. NX: **v2606**. Bridge protocol: **1**.
Canonical manifest SHA-256: `0bc6f76bf3845c3f10b0b60faba9fa2c666cc20f1a8a7448ef19d252dc41e286`.

These labels report manifest evidence, not certification or independent verification of its claims. Native-tested means status `tested` with an evidence type beginning `real_NX_`; only the stated scope and NX version are covered. Contract/sidecar-tested does not establish native CAD correctness. Experimental includes untested entries and tested entries without a recognized evidence type. Unavailable capabilities are explicitly recorded by the manifest; absence from this matrix is not proof of availability or unavailability.

## Explicitly unavailable capabilities

These are capability names, separate from the tool counts above.

- batch_model_viewport_image
- union_of_all_pairwise_interference_volumes

## Manifest limitations

- No general certification
- Native save expires undo marks
- Checkpoint recovery does not survive NX process restart
- Exact bounds require axis-aligned WCS
- Assembly import can conflict with loaded STEP prototype names
- Modified-object tracking is explicit-only; null means not comprehensive
- Batch structural preflight is not a geometric dry run
- Cooperative cancellation happens between operations only
- Absolute placement currently supports immediate children
- MCP desktop clients must refresh tool schemas after deployment
- CLIFF vendor STEP conversion still returns no bodies with NX v2606 translators; logs and rolled-back new-part outcome are returned. No vendor-geometry repair is claimed.
- Adam Tech vendor geometry has two self-intersecting faces (875315); health diagnostics resolve faces and error text. Native healing failed on a disposable copy and was rolled back.
- Drawing centerline visibility is inspectable but not writable: the tested native setter did not persist.
